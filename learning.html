        <h2>Learning</h2>
        <p>Here's what I'm currently learning.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Healthcare</b>
                <p>I'm interested in healthcare and the ways we can improve human lives. There are huge opportunities
                to better our healthcare system in the US. Technology has a outsized impact here in
                (1) organizing and understanding big healthcare data (images, medical records, etc.)
                (2) providing a more patient-centric, compassionate healthcare experience
                (3) personalization of therapies and treatments
                (4) frequent passive signals into patient health via wearables
                (5) acceleration of clinical R&D
                (6) increasing access to care via telemedicine. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Artificial Intelligence</b>
                <p>I'm interested in artificial intelligence and it's applications. After all
                    "Artificial intelligence is the new electricity." - Andrew Ng. I'm currently learning about
                    deep learning and computer vision. I'm particularly interested in neural networks.</p>
            </li>
             <li>
                <b>Brain Computer Interfaces</b>
                <p>I'm interested in brain computer interfaces. I'm fascinated by the potential applications in
                    learning, medicine and gaming. I think brain computer interfaces have the potential to
                    change how we perceive the world and how we think, learn, remember and transfer information to one another.
                    Here's a rare, brief
                    <a href="https://youtu.be/I0zXkwLs_lo?t=688">few minutes of an interview</a> with
                    Gaben, who discusses applications in gaming.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Philosophy</b>
                <p>I'm curious about philosophy. I'm particularly interested in emergent properties of complex
                systems and organizations/organizational behavior.</p>
